Justina interpreter v1.2.1 - release notes
------------------------------------------

v1.1.1
------
initial version

v1.2.1		
------
new functionality: 
- when a program is deleted, any breakpoints set receive status 'draft' instead of being deleted as well.
- introduction of two new commands: moveBP (move breakpoint to another source line) and BPactivate (remove breakpoint status 'draft') 
- clearBP command can now clear all breakpoints at once, without having to specify source lines
- user manual adapted to cover new functionality
bugs solved:
- creating a Justina object without passing input and output streams does not correctly initialize default input and output stream
- clearProg and clearMem command: char* too short, risking memory corruption
- loadProg command: default console does not always refer to correct input stream
