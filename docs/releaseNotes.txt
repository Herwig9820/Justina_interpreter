Justina interpreter v1.2.1 - release notes
------------------------------------------

v1.1.1
------
initial version

v1.2.1		
------
new functionality: 
- when a program is deleted, any breakpoints set receive status 'draft' instead of being deleted.
- introduction of two new commands: moveBP (move breakpoint to another source line) and BPactivate (remove breakpoint status 'draft') 
- clearBP command can now clear all breakpoints at once, without having to specify source lines
- user manual adapted to cover new functionality
bugs solved:
- creating a Justina object without passing input and output streams does not correctly initialize default input and output stream
- clearProg and clearMem command: char* too short, risking memory corruption
- loadProg command: default console does not always refer to correct input stream

v1.3.1
------
new functionality:
- user c++ functions, implementing 'external' Justina commands
- Justina procedures (not returning a value)
- debugging: layout of STOP and BREAK lines changed to increase clarity
- user manual adapted to cover new functionality
bugs solved:
- processor resets or hangs when using r() function 
- if undefined function encountered in program: processor resets or hangs while printing function name
