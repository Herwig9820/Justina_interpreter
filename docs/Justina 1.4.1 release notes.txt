Release notes
-------------------------------------------------

v1.1.1 (May 29, 2024)
------
initial version

v1.2.1 (July 2, 2024)		
---------------------
new functionality: 
- when a program is deleted, any breakpoints set receive status 'draft' instead of being deleted.
- introduction of two new commands: moveBP (move breakpoint to another source line) and BPactivate (remove breakpoint status 'draft') 
- clearBP command can now clear all breakpoints at once, without having to specify source lines
- user manual adapted to cover new functionality
bugs solved:
- creating a Justina object without passing input and output streams does not correctly initialize default input and output stream
- clearProg and clearMem command: char array too short, risking memory corruption
- loadProg command: default console does not always refer to correct input stream

v1.3.1 (July 30, 2024)
----------------------
new functionality:
- user c++ functions, implementing 'external' (c++) Justina commands (NOT returning a result)
- Justina procedures ('procedure(...);', NOT returning a value)
- debugging: layout of STOP and BREAK lines changed to increase clarity
- user manual adapted to cover new functionality
bugs solved:
- processor resets or hangs when using r() function 
- if undefined function encountered in program: processor resets or hangs while printing function name  

v1.3.2 (February 14, 2025)
--------------------------
new functionality:
- Arduino nano 33 BLE microcontroller added (ARDUINO_ARCH_NRF52840 architecture)
 
v1.3.3 (February 15, 2025)
--------------------------
- library version correctly maintained in library.properties file (no new features)

v1.4.1 (September 8, 2025)
-------------------------- 
- various small improvements and bug corrections
- simple 'TCP keep alive' feature implemented in Justina example program 'Justina_TCPIP_server.ino'  
- new example program 'Justina_TCPIP_server_multi.ino' (multiple concurrent clients and client session management)
- new Justina-language program 'web_cal2.jus' (scientific calculator as a web page, multiple concurrent clients and client session management),
  works together with 'Justina_TCPIP_server_multi.ino'
- implementation of batch files:
  * batch files can call other batch files
  * call a batch file, passing up to 9 arguments
  * labels, conditional loops
  * load and execute programs automatically
- autostart functionality (if SD card connected): executes batch file 'autorun.jba' (if found) after power on or reset
