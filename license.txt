*    Justina is an interpreter which does NOT require you to use an IDE to write                            *
*    and compile programs. Programs are written on the PC using any text processor                          *
*    and transferred to the Arduino using any serial terminal capable of sending files.                     *
*    Justina can store and retrieve programs and other data on an SD card as well.                          *
*                                                                                                           *
